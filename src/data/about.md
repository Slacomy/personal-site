# Intro

I've always loved video games, ever since I was 8 and would sit near my dad and watch him play Everquest and Ultima. From there, I started to play those games too, and then find games myself to introduce him to. With playing video games comes wanting to understand them, and with understanding them comes wanting to create them! 
My ultimate dream is to be able to create something that inspires others the same way I've been inspired.

# Currently

As a gradute of Wilkes University, I've gained the skills needed to work in the development and design of both web and video game platforms. I work in Unity and ReactJS on projects in both of those fields.

# The Lore

- My dad is known by anyone who knows him as the one to give your old tech to. I grew up with desktop towers taken apart on my kitchen table, with my dad using tweezers to point really close and tell me what each part did. 

- I actually started using HTML in 2012, without even knowing. I used DeviantArt, as many kids my age did, and didn't even realize what tags were, or why typing certain letters before words made them bold, or what the nonsense I typed in to add an image even meant! When I took a class years later and learned I'd been doing this for a while, I was very pleasantly surprised!

# I like

- Books, especially YA Urban Fiction
- Musicals
- Swimming
- Music, especially Rock and Punk-Pop
- Puzzle Games (Don't ask how many hours of sodoku I've played)
- Cooking
- Cosplay/Costume Design
